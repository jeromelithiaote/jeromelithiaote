With a passion for exploring the boundaries of visuals and sounds, J3ZZ's artistic journey is characterized by a **fusion of genres and a commitment to creative experimentation**. Drawing inspiration from improvised music, electronic ambient, and the traditional rhythms of Maloya, J3ZZ creates immersive and captivating visual & sonic experiences that transport listeners to **new realms of imagination**.

*"I see myself as a **protean author artist**, as much as a performer, violinist, composer, producer, visual and sound designer as in the themes of my work, where the themes of **gathering and legitimacy** constantly intersect with those of **dialogue and code sharing**. This permeability is also part of the artist and engineer in me, bringing a know-how acquired through multiple experiences around the world."*

*"I develop artistic, technological and social projects that transmit, in a roundabout way, knowledge and values, which raise questions about our environment. My creative process is part of **a social, cultural and artistic approach**. My desire is to develop actions **accessible to all**, documented, rich and synonymous with discovery and dialogue."*

*"I believe that arts, culture, education and science are the best way to grow and live in society. My artistic research consists of creating **a bridge between humans and Nature**, experimenting and playing through various mediums such as conferences, online tools, workshops, installations in festivals and cities to give a chance to see and **to consciously appreciate our environment as a society and to inspire self-change first in our daily lives and then in our political and economic environments**."*
