# Basic Concept

-->

Visitors explore the interactions between humans and plants by transforming the **bio-signals** of plants into **visual and auditory stimuli**.

------------

# Audiovisual Components
The project uses **bioelectrical sensors to capture the micro-electrical variations** in plants through the "Vibrotanica box," a device designed by the artist himself. These signals are then transformed into data to generate **real-time sounds and visuals**. The installation features an immersive sound system, high-definition video projectors, and a complex software interface that enables the creation of ambisonic visuals and sounds. These technologies work together to create an **immersive atmosphere where each interaction between the visitors and the plants triggers a unique audiovisual response**.

------------

# Themes and Messages
**Vibrotanica** is an artistic and technological exploration that immerses the audience in the profound and **symbiotic relationship between humans and plants**. This installation not only aims to raise awareness about the importance of the environment and biodiversity but also seeks to evoke strong emotions related to **empathy, the fragility of our ecosystem, and the intimate connection between humans and nature**.
The goal is to foster enlightened **awareness and mindfulness** of our place within the natural universe. The installation highlights the **universality of the bond between all forms of life** while inviting an **inner transformation**, subtly altering the audience's perception to better understand the impact of our actions on the environment. Through this geopoetic, collective, and educational experience, **Vibrotanica** aspires to strengthen this fragile yet powerful connection with nature, creating a moment of **reflection, wonder, and transformation.**
In addition to raising awareness about biodiversity preservation, the work offers a fusion of science, art, and nature, transforming the bio-signals of plants into audiovisual stimuli. This allows visitors to experience an immersive environment where they can directly **interact with the plants, promoting a socially enriching and inclusive experience**.

------------

# Target Audience
**Vibrotanica** targets a broad spectrum of participants, making the experience **accessible and engaging for a diverse audience**. The project places special emphasis on including marginalized or underserved groups by leveraging the **strong sensory dimension** of the installation, which **engages touch, sight, and hearing**. This sensory aspect ensures that individuals with specific needs can partake in a unique immersive experience.
Additionally, the work is designed for an **intergenerational** audience, aiming to foster connections and the sharing of memories, stories, and experiences across generations. It creates a space where people of all ages can come together, interact, and share a common experience, thereby **strengthening familial and social bonds through the exploration of nature**.

------------

# Staging and Scenography
The staging of **Vibrotanica** is meticulously designed to **amplify the connection between the ordinary and the extraordinary**. The solemn lighting, focused on the plants, creates an **intimate and familiar atmosphere**, evoking the common imagery of potted plants, **grounding** the work in something recognizable for the audience.

Simultaneously, **large-scale visual projections** immerses the audience in the reactions of the plants and their interactions with their immediate environment, including the artist and the audience. These visuals, layered within the spectator's field of vision, allow for **deep immersion** in the symbiotic relationship developing on stage.
The fog, generated by machines, evokes the **humidity of tropical forests**, adding an additional sensory dimension to the experience. The biological data capture system, designed by the artist, is highlighted, emphasizing the technological link that deserves daily awareness. Finally, the sound diffusion system is intentionally kept "invisible" so that the **focus remains on the interaction between the artist, the plants, and the visual elements**.

------------

# Objectives and Impact
The ultimate goal of **Vibrotanica** goes beyond offering an immersive and spectacular experience of **high artistic and technical quality**. The work aspires to have a profound **impact on the audience's ecological and artistic consciousness**. By exploring the relationship between humans, living organisms, and technology, it aims to **transform the way each individual relates to the natural world while encouraging reflection on the use of technology in daily life**. The installation seeks to foster a deeper and more respectful **awareness of living beings, as well as a critical reflection on how technology is integrated into our interactions with the environment**.
