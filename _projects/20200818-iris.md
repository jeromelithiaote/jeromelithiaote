*"IRIS is a kinetic light installation inspired by different forms of light reflections. Its physical movement and photometric reflection are closely related to the characteristics of water. Its main elements are controllable but its smaller parts have their natural randomness. Its central element is gravity, which framing the smallest details of our world on universal scale.""* - András Nagy

Light. Images. Light/images. Moving lights. Moving images. Moving/light/images. Framed and free flowing light waves, sculptural light objects. The ON sight specific group exhibition presents works by artists of Lighthouse light art society at an unusual location by utilizing the special atmosphere of Csokonai Theatre in Debrecen and turning it into an impromptu art gallery.

The artworks, symbolizing the constant change and variable permanence, invite the audience to experience light in its many forms in person. The analogue and digital light art pieces and kinetic installations present the opportunity to explore manmade structures, reflective surfaces and light as a medium.
