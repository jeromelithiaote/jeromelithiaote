# Workshop Concept

<!-- #TODO add picture
<img src="/images/proj/encode_imputation/ecos_logo.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
-->

The biosonification workshop draws inspiration from the [Vibrotanica](/vibrotanica) project to offer an introduction to biosonification. This workshop invites participants to discover the secret **music of plants** by transforming their **bioelectrical signals** into unique sound compositions. It immerses participants in an experience where technology and nature converge to reveal the hidden symphony of the natural world. Participants will leave with **a renewed appreciation for the plant world and the endless possibilities of sound creation**.


------------

# Workshop Objectives

| **Scientific Exploration** | Introduce participants to how plants generate bioelectrical signals that can be captured and transformed into sound. |
| **Ecological Awareness**: | Enhance participants' understanding of the connections between humans and the plant world, using music as a medium for expression and connection. |
| **Inspiration and Curiosity**: | Spark interest in exploring new forms of artistic and scientific expression. |

# Workshop Content

##### 1. Introduction to Biosonification (15 minutes)
>
* **Brief Presentation:**
A simple explanation of biosonification and its importance in understanding the interaction between technology, art, and nature.
* **Overview of the Vibrotanica Project:**
A quick introduction to the Vibrotanica project and how it uses biosonification to create an immersive experience.

##### 2. Technical Demonstration (15 minutes)
>
* **Introduction to Tools:**
Explanation of the sensors and electronic equipment used to capture the plants' signals.
* **Live Demonstration:**
Real-time illustration of capturing a plant’s bioelectrical signals and transforming them into sounds.

##### 3. Hands-On Experience (20 minutes)
>
* **Interaction with Plants:**
Participants are invited to gently touch the plants or expose them to light or water to observe the resulting sound changes.
* **Listening and Observation:**
Participants are encouraged to listen closely to the sounds produced and observe the plants' reactions in real-time.

##### 4. Listening and Reflection Session (10 minutes)
>
* **Feedback:**
Participants share their impressions and what they have learned.
* **Summary and Q&A:**
A recap of the workshop and answers to participants' questions.
* **Discussion and Conclusion:**
A reflection on the creative processes, the experience, and the emotions evoked by the sounds produced from the plant signals.

**Target Audience**: This workshop is designed to be **accessible to everyone**, from music enthusiasts to nature and technology lovers. It is ideal for a diverse audience, including individuals with **specific needs**, thanks to its strong sensory dimension.

**Duration**: The workshop can be adapted based on the context, ranging **from a 1-hour session for a quick introduction to a full-day experience (6 to 8 hours)** for a deeper exploration. The longer format includes segments dedicated to learning, creating, and collective reflection.

**Required**:
* Bioelectrical sensors for capturing plant signals. (Provided by the artist.)
* Computers equipped with sound creation and processing software. (Provided by the artist.)
* Plants with leaves suitable for attaching 2cm x 2cm sensors. (To be provided by the event organizer.)
* Audio systems for broadcasting the final compositions. (To be provided by the event organizer. For further details, please refer to the technical sheet.)
* Tables, chairs, electrical outlets, and extension cords. (To be provided by the event organizer.)

**Location**: The workshop can be held in various settings, such as music studios, cultural centers, or even outdoors, in environments that inspire sound exploration.
